- 👋 Hi, I’m @PlatypusMocharist
- 👀 I’m interested in Art, Music, all the sciences, American legal system, philosophy, and a slew of other things.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Pascal scripting
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing as of yet
- 📫 How to reach me N/A
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: Not only is the Platypus the only egg-laying mammal, but it also secretes milk via glands in its skin, and has ankle spures that can inject one of the most potent toxins of the animal kingdom.
- Clearly, the Playtpus was one of "Gods" last creations, and cobbled together with left-over parts. Which is a perfect analogy to software engineering!
